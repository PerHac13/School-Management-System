# School Management System

## Overview

This School Management System is a C++ project designed as a learning opportunity for intermediate to advanced C++ programmers. It demonstrates the use of modern C++ features, object-oriented programming principles, and integrates various software development practices.

## Features

- Create and manage multiple schools
- Add classes to schools
- Add students to classes
- Save and load data using JSON files
- Command-line interface for user interaction

## Prerequisites

- C++17 compatible compiler (e.g., GCC 7+, Clang 5+, MSVC 2017+)
- CMake 3.10 or higher
- Git (for version control)

## Setup and Build

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd school_management_system
   ```

2. Create a build directory and run CMake:

   ```
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   ```

3. Build the project:

   ```
   make
   ```

4. Run the program:
   ```
   ./SchoolManagementSystem
   ```

## Development Milestones

### Milestone 1: Basic Structure and Functionality

- [x] Set up project structure with CMake
- [x] Implement basic classes (School, Class, Student)
- [x] Create a simple command-line interface
- [x] Implement JSON serialization and deserialization

### Milestone 2: Enhanced Functionality and Error Handling

- [ ] Implement input validation for all user inputs
- [ ] Add error handling using try-catch blocks
- [ ] Create custom exceptions for specific error scenarios
- [ ] Implement a logging system to track operations and errors

### Milestone 3: Advanced Features

- [ ] Add more complex queries (e.g., find students by age range)
- [ ] Implement class average calculations
- [ ] Add support for courses and grades
- [ ] Create reports (e.g., student performance, class statistics)

### Milestone 4: Performance and Scalability

- [ ] Optimize data structures for larger datasets
- [ ] Implement multithreading for improved performance
- [ ] Add database support (e.g., SQLite) for persistent storage

### Milestone 5: User Interface and Experience

- [ ] Develop a graphical user interface using Qt or wxWidgets
- [ ] Implement user authentication and access levels
- [ ] Create a dashboard for quick overview of school statistics

### Milestone 6: Testing and Documentation

- [ ] Write unit tests using Google Test or Catch2
- [ ] Implement integration tests
- [ ] Create comprehensive documentation using Doxygen
- [ ] Write a user manual

## Learning Objectives

1. **Modern C++ Features**: Utilize C++17 features like structured bindings, if constexpr, and std::optional.
2. **Object-Oriented Design**: Apply SOLID principles and design patterns.
3. **Memory Management**: Use smart pointers and RAII techniques.
4. **Generic Programming**: Implement templates for reusable components.
5. **Standard Library**: Leverage containers, algorithms, and utilities from the C++ Standard Library.
6. **Third-party Libraries**: Integrate and use external libraries (e.g., JSON for Modern C++).
7. **Build Systems**: Gain proficiency with CMake for cross-platform project management.
8. **Version Control**: Practice Git workflows and collaborative development.
9. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling and logging mechanisms.
10. **Multithreading**: Apply concurrent programming techniques for performance optimization.
11. **GUI Development**: Create user-friendly interfaces using C++ GUI frameworks.
12. **Database Integration**: Connect and interact with SQL databases from C++.
13. **Testing**: Write and maintain unit and integration tests.
14. **Documentation**: Create clear and comprehensive documentation for the project.
